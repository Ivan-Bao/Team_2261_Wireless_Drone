This folder contains two Matlab codes that compute the mutual inductance
between two circular loops of radius Rp and Rs (with Rp >= Rs), whose
centers are separated by a vector pc=[xc,yc,zc], and normal to the plane
of secondary loop is n=[a,b,c], with absolute tolerance "tol" (default: 1e-10)

The first code (Grover_179.m) refers to the Grover's formula (179) published in:

F. W. Grover, Proceedings of the I.R.E., 1944, pp. 620-629.

The second code (Babic_24.m) refers to Babic's formula (24) published in:

S. Babic, F. Sirois, C. Akyel and C. Girardi, IEEE Trans. Magn., 2010, at press.

Two examples (Example_10.m and Example_11.m) are also provide as example of use
of the above functions. The details about these examples are provided in the above
paper.

Programmed by F. Sirois and S. Babic
Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, June 2009
